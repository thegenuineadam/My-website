           <h1>Hello! I'm Adam Lohiya, from London.</h1>
           <h3>Why I'd like to be a web developer:</h3>
           <p>If I had to pick my favourite thing in the world, it would be learning new skills. I've grown to love the process of exploring the unfamiliar, figuring out how it works, and then mastering it. Web development is ideal for me because it feeds my love of learning new things, through its constantly developing tools, languages and problems. The idea of always having something new to learn is what keeps me motivated.</p>
           <p>One of the aspects I enjoy most about web development is the opportunity to take away something from every challenge. Whether it's figuring out if iteration or a recursive loop is more efficient, creating a responsive design, or experimenting with a new framework that I've never encountered before, I know for a fact that I come out of each challenge a little better, a little more knowledgeable. I find it incredibly satisfying to take on a challenge and come out the other side with a new skill under my belt.</p>
           <p>The skills I gain in web development also have applications in the real world, which makes the learning process all the more rewarding. There is something so fulfilling about building something meaningful and functional, knowing that what I have learned will help create a better user experience for people, or solve practical problems. It's the combination of constant learning and tangible impact that draws me to this field.</p>
           <p>Ultimately, web development aligns perfectly with my passion for learning and self-improvement. I find myself excited by the prospect of a career that not only allows me to do what I love but also challenges me to keep growing, day by day.</p>
